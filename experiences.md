- when you have ros in your computer, pip freeze will put ros libraries in requirement.txt. Even invirtual environemnts. To dodge it use ```pipreqs``` to automatically detect which modules you are using.
- when you have requirements.txt, create conda enviornment and use ```pip install -r requirements``` to install modules from files.
